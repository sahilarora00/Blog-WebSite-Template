            <h2>1) Identify a Profitable Niche</h2>
            <p>Choosing the right business idea is crucial when you have a limited budget. Look for a niche market that
                aligns with your skills, interests, and experience. Conduct thorough market research to identify
                untapped opportunities and areas where you can provide unique value. By focusing on a specific niche,

            <p>Creating a comprehensive business plan is essential, regardless of your budget. However, when operating
                on a low budget, it's important to keep your plan lean and focused. Outline your business objectives,
                target market, products or services, pricing strategy, marketing plan, and financial projections. By

            <p>Bootstrapping is a concept of starting and growing your business with minimal external funding. It involves cutting unnecessary expenses, utilizing personal savings, and being resourceful. Prioritize your spending by investing in essential elements such as product development, marketing, and customer acquisition. Be frugal with non-essential expenditures and consider cost-saving measures like remote work, sharing office spaces, or buying used equipment.</p>

Leverage social media platforms, create engaging content, and build a strong online presence. Utilize search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to improve your website's visibility in search engine results.

Building relationships and connections can lead to partnerships, collaborations, and word-of-mouth referrals. Look for mentorship opportunities or seek advice from experienced entrepreneurs who can provide guidance and support.</p>

            <p>In the early stages of your business, your customers are your biggest advocates. Provide exceptional customer service and prioritize customer satisfaction. Engage with your customers, actively listen to their feedback, and make improvements based on their input. Happy customers will not only become repeat buyers but also refer others to your business, helping you grow organically.</p>
